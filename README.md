Comparative analysis of ML aglorithms for Bank Default predictions

# Abstract
Bank default can be treated as a binary classification problem to obtain predictions on whether a
financial institution is at risk of bankruptcy or not. In this paper we apply the three most widely
used classification algorithms, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector
Machines, discussing their mathematical background, to a wide dataset encompassing data from
7783 banks. We consider feature selection methods such as ANOVA and PCA and apply SMOTE
to solve the class imbalance problem. The results show that the Random Forest algorithms
provides the highest AUROC score, although the performance across models is competitive.
